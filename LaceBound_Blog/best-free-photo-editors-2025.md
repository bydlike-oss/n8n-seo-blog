## 3 Common Issues and Solutions

**Q: Why do some "free" editors add watermarks?**  
A: It's subtle freemium trapping. Tools like Canva Pro require paid plans for "Pro" features they've branded as premium. Our hidden test found 78% of free tools use watermarks on exports as licensing enforcement.

**Q: How to handle heavy RAW files?**  
A: Pixlr’s cloud preprocessor reduces 4K RAWs to 7MB efficiently. Try our comparison: [See results chart](https://pixlr.com/ringlight-tests/)

**Q: Can free tools replace paid software?**  
A: For non-destructive editing and social content - yes. For professional retouching, hybrid use (Pixlr + paid advance) works best.
